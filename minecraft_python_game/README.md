# PyCraft — Voxel Survival Sandbox in Python

An original, playable 3D Minecraft-inspired voxel survival sandbox game written in Python using the **Ursina Engine (Panda3D)**, **NumPy**, and **Pillow**.

All textures, icons, sound effects, and 3D models are generated procedurally—no external or proprietary assets are required.

---

## 1. Python Version

- **Python 3.10+** (Tested on **Python 3.10 – 3.13**)
- Cross-platform: runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## 2. Installation Command

Unpack `minecraft_python_game.zip` (or clone/open the project directory) and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
unzip minecraft_python_game.zip -d pycraft
cd pycraft
```

---

## 3. How to Install Dependencies

Create an optional virtual environment and install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. How to Launch the Game

Run `main.py` with Python:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

*(Note: If running in a headless CI/container environment without an X11/Wayland display, you can run `python3 main.py --headless` or `xvfb-run -a python3 main.py`.)*

## 5. Controls

| Input | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **W / S / A / D** | Walk Forward / Backward / Strafe Left / Strafe Right |
| **Shift** (hold) | Sprint (moves faster, consumes slightly more hunger) |
| **Space** | Jump (or Swim Upward while in water) |
| **Mouse** | First-person camera look |
| **Left Mouse** (hold / click) | Break targeted block (with mining progress bar) or Melee Attack targeted mob |
| **Right Mouse** | Place selected block, open targeted Crafting Table / Furnace, or eat held food |
| **1 – 9** | Select Hotbar slot (1–9) |
| **Mouse Wheel** | Cycle Hotbar slot selection |
| **E** | Open / Close Inventory, Crafting, and Furnace screen |
| **F** | Eat currently selected food item |
| **Esc** | Open Pause Menu or close open Inventory/Settings screen |

---

## 6. Save Location

All world saves and persistent user settings are stored locally in the `saves/` directory at the project root:

- **World Saves**: `saves/<world_name>.json` (with automatic `.json.bak` recovery backup)
  - Stores world name, deterministic seed, difficulty, world time & day count, player position/orientation, health, hunger, 36-slot inventory, hotbar selection, broken & placed blocks, chests, and furnace state.
- **Game Settings**: `saves/settings.json`
  - Stores mouse sensitivity, FOV, render distance, master volume, music toggle, SFX toggle, graphics quality, fullscreen mode, and keep-inventory preference.
